## Project Setup
Create a React App: Start by setting up a new React project using create-react-app or a custom Webpack setup.

## Install Necessary Dependencies:
React Router: For managing routes if you have multiple pages.
Material-UI or Ant Design: For a sleek and modern UI.
Chart.js or Recharts: For integrating charts and visualizations.
Redux or Context API: For state management if the application grows complex.
Axios: For handling HTTP requests.
FilePond or react-dropzone: For file uploads.
Lodash: For data manipulation and utility functions.

        ```
            bash
            npm install
        ```
## Start the development server:
    ```
        bash
        npm start
    ```
The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Dashboard Theme:
Choose a theme or provide a theme switcher (dark mode/light mode).
Ensure the theme is responsive and works well on all screen sizes.

## Data Sources:
Backend: Create a RESTful API or GraphQL service to fetch data.
Database Integration: Connect to databases (like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) to pull data for visualization.
APIs: Integrate third-party APIs if necessary.

## Analytics Types:
Line Charts: For time series data.
Bar Graphs: For categorical data comparison.
Pie Charts: For proportional data.
Heatmaps: For showing density or concentration in data.
Scatter Plots: For relationships between datasets.
KPI Widgets: Display key metrics prominently.

## File Formats for Data Upload:
CSV: Handle comma-separated values, often used in data exports.
JSON: For structured data, especially from APIs.
Excel: Use libraries like SheetJS (XLSX) to handle Excel uploads.

## User Roles:
Admin: Full access to all features, including data upload, editing, and deletion.
User: View-only access with limited interactions like filters and search.

## Additional Features:
Filters: Allow users to filter data by date, category, and other criteria.
Search Functionality: Implement a search bar for quick data access.
Real-Time Updates: Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live data updates.
Export Options: Allow users to download visualizations in PDF, PNG, or CSV formats.
Notifications: Implement a notification system for real-time alerts or updates.
